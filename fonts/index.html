    <p id="one">This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</p>
    <p id="two">And maybe a little bush lives there. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.</p>
    <p id="three">Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako.</p>
    <p class="four">And maybe a little bush lives there. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.

    <p class="five">Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Let your imagination be your guide. Poor old tree.</p>
    <p class="six">There we go. Just make little strokes like that. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day.</p>
